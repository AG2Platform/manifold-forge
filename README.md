## What Was Built

This project is an interactive demo simulating multiagent orchestration in a customer support scenario. Users can input a question, and three agents (Intake, Analysis, Response) process it step-by-step. The UI visualizes each agent's state, animates the workflow, and displays a live log of agent actions. All logic is mocked for demonstration purposes.
